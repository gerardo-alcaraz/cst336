                <p>As students in the computer science world, creating accounts for various websites and applications comes with the territory.  Each of those accounts
                have (hopefully) different passwords for each account.  Although you may remember 3 different passwords, but once you have to create 10 different passwords for 
                10 different websites, it could be quite confusing. In this website you will learn how to choose an effective password, learn the ease of cracking passwords, and finally how
                to remember a password.</p>
